# Project-overview

## What is Waste Way?
Waste Way is a mobile app – dashboard tech solution that uses image processing technology to allow user to scan a trash collection wastebin and send an alert to the waste collection authority to alert them when trash bin is full and the percentage of the bin to being full. The mobile app can also scan areas that are polluted by improper waste dumping, the app feature includes a location – tag of the waste to be collected.
 Waste is a global issue. If not properly dealt with, waste poses a threat to public health and the environment. It is a growing issue linked directly to the way society produces and consumes. It concerns everyone. Waste management is one of the essential utility services underpinning society in the 21st century, particularly in urban areas. Waste management is a basic human need and can also be regarded as a ‘basic human right’. Ensuring proper sanitation and solid waste management sits alongside the provision of potable water, shelter, food, energy, transport and communications as essential to society and to the economy as a whole. Despite this, the public and political profile of waste management is often lower than other utility services. Unfortunately, the consequences of doing little or even nothing to address waste management can be very costly to society and to the economy overall. In the absence of waste regulations and their rigorous implementation and enforcement, a generator of waste will tend to opt for the cheapest available course of action. For example, household solid waste may be dumped in the street, on vacant land, or into drains, streams or other watercourses, uor it may be burned to lessen the nuisance of accumulated piles of waste.
How We Identified The Problem
Through design thinking process, we were able to brainstorm and come up with different ideas to tackle climate change in Clean Water and Sanitation Category. The screenshot above shows some of the ideas we had to help in efficient waste collection system using cutting edge technology, as such innovative and environmentally friendly solutions must be developed to ensure efficient waste collection whilst simultaneously preserving people’s quality of life.
 
 
## Short Description
### The Problem
Waste Management in the present time is known to everyone but unfortunately, it is neglected by numerous people that are utilized to portray exercises for waste segregation to take care of issues brought about by wrong garbage disposal. Illegal dumping has been a constant issue in numerous urban communities on the planet. The smells and pollutants brought about by deserted household and unloaded trash, and construction leftovers ruin the city as well as threatens the wellbeing of the citizens. The scattering of waste and overfilling of trash bins without proper collection response leaves the environment to suffer, as such initiatives should be taken to improve waste collection from source.
Despite the vast number of solutions implemented by the competent authorities, the process of garbage management and collection is still not well executed. The garbage generated is comparatively more than the amount of  the garbage which is managed on a daily basis. Hence forth taking all these factors into consideration a smart system could present a viable solution towards efficient waste management/collection. The main aim of our project is to provide a low-cost, accurate and easy-to-use solution for collecting the garbage effectively and well on time.
Through the use of powerful technology such as image/object processing and recognition, our project focuses on creating a web – phone application interface where a user can either take a picture or scan a recycle bin, which would allow the image/processed image to be sent to waste collection authority, the message relayed comes with a pinned location of waste collection bin(point).
The waste collection authorities can be alerted of the waste that needs to be collected in the designated areas of collection.
How Can Technology Help
 Collection of waste well in time
 (add some more)
## Innovation
-Waste classification  in terms of material composition of waste i.e Waste can be analysed to know the amount of plastic,paper,metal,glass etc.
-To calculate volume of waste generated by a household or a municipality,the information can be used in future planning for landfill designs
-To understand the common type of waste output identified in a specific area  and help  reduce volume of and demand for materials that create the biggest waste footprint (plastics, electronics, food, textile), and encourage reuse/recycle opportunities :collision:
